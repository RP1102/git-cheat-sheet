        <h1># Get Started</h1>
        <p>
          First off, you want to enable <span class="bold">git commands</span> for your project, you'll need to open your projet folder in the command line and run <code>git init</code>.<br/>
          At this point you should be able to run <code>git status</code>. It will tell you if you have changes that are yet to be <span class="bold">added</span> or <span class="bold">comitted</span>.<br/>
        </p>
        <p class="callout">
          <span class="bold">Note :</span> If youâ€™re working on your own and don't really want to track preciselly the state of your project, I recommand to skip to the part where I talk about the commands you'll need.
        </p>
          <p>
            Now you might want to use a <span class="bold">git client</span> such as <span class="bold">GitHub</span> in order to have a clearer view of your project compared to what you would get with going full command line. <br/>
            To do so you'll need to link your local directory to a remote repository.
            It's pretty straight forward, first,  log in to the <span class="bold">git client</span> of your choice and simply create a new repository there.
            You will find yourself with multiple commands you'll have to run in order to link your project, some of which you've already ran. <br/><br/>
        
            Platform like github also allow you to work from existing base, it's called cloning. You can clone a project with the command <code>git clone</code>.
            When <span class="bold">cloned</span>, a project is <span class="bold">automatically initialized</span>, this means you don't need to run <code>git init</code>. <br/><br/>
            If you chose to start your project from scratch, you might have came across the <code>git add</code>, <code>git commit</code> and <code>git push</code> commands. It's time for us to talk about these, because you're about to use them very often from now on.
